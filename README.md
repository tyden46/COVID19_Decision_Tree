# Generating the Decision Tree </br>
First run the Generate_COVID19_Dataset.R script. This will fetch the most recent data compiled by Xu et al (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0448-0#Sec2) </br>
Then run the Generate_COVID19_Decision_Tree.R script. This will generate a decision tree. Because the dataset is frequently updated, the tree may change over time.
